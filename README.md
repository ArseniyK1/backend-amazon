Introduction
The Backend Amazon project is a backend application that serves as the foundation for an e-commerce platform. It provides various functionalities related to user management, product catalog, orders, and reviews. The project is designed to offer seamless CRUD operations for different entities and features robust user authentication using FakerJS, argon2, PassportJS, and JWT-token.

Implemented Features
CRUD Operations
The backend has been developed to support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the following entities:

User: Users can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted. This allows the management of user accounts and information.

Product: Products can be added, viewed, modified, and removed. This enables the management of the product catalog.

Order: The application supports creating new orders, fetching existing orders, updating order details, and deleting orders.

Category: Categories can be managed through CRUD operations, allowing for the addition, retrieval, update, and removal of product categories.

Review: Users can leave reviews for products, and these reviews can be read, updated, or deleted.

OrderItem: The application allows the management of order items within an order, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting items.

Authentication
The application features a robust user authentication system that ensures secure access to the platform. The authentication process involves the use of the following technologies:

FakerJS: Used for populating the database with mock user data, making it easier to test and develop the application.

argon2: Employed for password hashing, which ensures that user passwords are securely stored in the database.

PassportJS: Integrated into the authentication flow to provide a simple and flexible authentication middleware.

JWT-token: JSON Web Tokens are utilized for secure user authentication and authorization, enabling the generation and validation of tokens for authenticated users.

Product Filtering
The backend supports product filtering based on categories and descriptions. Users can search and retrieve products based on specific categories or keywords in the product descriptions, improving the shopping experience.

Technologies Used
The Backend Amazon project is built using the following key technologies and libraries:

Node.js: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side.

Express: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to build the application's routes and middleware.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and manage the application's data efficiently.

Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing a straightforward schema-based solution for modeling application data.

FakerJS: A library for generating fake data, used for populating the database during development and testing.

argon2: A hashing library utilized to securely hash and validate user passwords.

PassportJS: An authentication middleware for Node.js, used to handle user authentication strategies.

JWT-token: JSON Web Tokens used for secure user authentication and authorization.

Setup and Installation
To set up the Backend Amazon project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository from GitHub.

Ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system.

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using npm install.

Set up your MongoDB connection string in the configuration file.

Run the application using npm start or any other appropriate script.

Usage
Once the application is up and running, you can use API testing tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the backend and perform CRUD operations on users, products, orders, categories, reviews, and order items. Additionally, you can test the authentication and product filtering functionalities.

Detailed API documentation can be found in the provided API documentation file.
